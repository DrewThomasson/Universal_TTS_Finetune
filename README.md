# Universal_TTS_Finetune
Attempt at making a universal script for fine-tuning a wide variety of tts models with a single command


## Extra Overkill for training models and such (All supported Coqio tts models and piper-tts in one easy command) 
- For info about this @DrewThomasson, he is currently working on the development of this, [work-in-progress-repo here](https://github.com/DrewThomasson/Universal_TTS_Finetune)
- [ ] Make a easy to use training gui for all coqio tts models in th ljspeech format training recipes [here from coqui tts](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/tree/dev/recipes/ljspeech)
- More info:

The GUI/headless should be as simple as:
- [On training piper-tts](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/blob/master/TRAINING.md)
- Good news! They all appear to use LJSpeech FORMAT! Even the standard Piper-tts training code!
- Remember tho that the dataset generator thing repo you linked makes the names of the files in the dataset in the metadata.csvfile like this "wavs/1272-128104-0000.wav" But the LJspeech trainers all appear to want it like this "1272-128104-0000", So you should probs make the dataset generating function your making take that into account and have the final metatdata.csv file that it'll use to pass into the many trainer functions.
- I plan on giving this a gradio gui potentially,
#### Step 1:
- Select model to fine-tune
- Give input audio file/files
- Press process and create dataset
#### Step 2: (Once Process dataset has been completed)
- Change any training parameters/config from standard training config for that selected model
- Press Train model
#### Step 3: (once training is complete)
- Load trained model
- Test influencing the trained/fine-tuned model 
- Export model & zipped dataset OR Export condensed model & zipped dataset
#### That's it! Planned to be simple as that! ðŸŽ‰

- Another Goal of this it to have it automatically be able to work on cpu and GPU, auto-selecting to whichever one is avalible
